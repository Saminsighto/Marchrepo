The Getting Started page in your Insighto.ai dashboard guides you through the essential steps to fully configure your agency workspace. This page is dynamic and updates in real-time as you complete each component of the setup process.

ðŸ”§ There are 4 key components to complete your agency setup:  
**Branding**  
Customize your agency's identity by adding logos, social profiles, and brand colors.

**Domain**  
Configure your agency domain and custom subdomains for proper white-label deployment.

**Billing**  
Create a billing plan or set up wallet-based billing for your subaccounts.

**Wallet / BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**  
Add funds to your wallet or provide your own provider API keys to enable services for your subaccounts.

âœ… **Real-Time Setup Progress**  
Each section on this page reflects the current setup status with color-coded indicators:

ðŸŸ¢ Green â€“ Completed  
ðŸŸ¡ Yellow â€“ Works but may need improvements  
ðŸ”´ Red â€“ Requires attention to proceed

Once all necessary configurations are completed, the status at the bottom of the page will show:

This ensures your agency is fully functional and ready to onboard clients and subaccounts.
