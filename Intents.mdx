Intents help Insighto automatically label conversations once they end‚Äîeither when the user closes them or they become inactive. When connected to a chat assistant, Insighto.ai identifies the intent behind each conversation and sends it by email to the right team or department. This ensures the right people get the information they need quickly.

> ‚ùó Note: The Intents feature works only with chat assistants.

## ‚ö° Auto Intents
 
1. Understand and Use Auto Intents

Insighto offers four pre-defined Auto Intents that you can use right away to categorize conversations:

- **CAREER**:  
  Tagged when someone asks about job openings or the application process. Sent to the HR team.

- **SALES**:  
  Tagged for questions about product pricing, availability, or features. Routed to the sales team.

- **LEAD**:  
  Triggered when a user asks about pricing and shares contact details (like email or phone). Sent to the right person for follow-up.

- **SUPPORT**:  
  Used when someone reports a problem or asks for technical help. Directed to the support team.

These intents help route conversations efficiently with no additional setup.
