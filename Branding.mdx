 8.  Set Up SMTP for Email Delivery

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used to send emails from your agency domain. Connect your SMTP credentials to ensure white-labeled emails (like Sign, forgot password or notifications) go out from your own email address.

ðŸ“Œ Example: If you're using Gmail (Google Workspace), you can use:

- **SMTP Host:** smtp.gmail.com  
- **Port:** 587  
- Use your Gmail address and App Password as credentials.

Check with your email provider for SMTP details and make sure less secure apps or app-specific passwords are enabled if required.

Click on Submit and then Test SMTP to make sure it's configured properly.
