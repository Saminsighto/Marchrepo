6. Go to Model Tab

Under this, the assistant is set to **Prompt** by default.

- The default LLM is **GPT-3.5**, but you can choose another model from the dropdown.
- Adjust the **temperature** if needed (higher = more creative, lower = more precise).

In the **Prompt** box, enter a simple instruction like:  
> “Greet the user and ask how you can assist them today.”  
or add your prompt according to your use-case.

> 💡 You can update this prompt anytime based on your assistant’s role.

8. Configure Voice Settings

In the **Voice** tab:

- **Recognizer Language** is set to English by default.  
  To use another language, remove English and select your preferred language from the list.
- **AI Voice** is set to Ava by default.  
  You can choose another voice from the dropdown.

Additional options:
- **Who speaks first** – Decide whether the assistant or user starts the conversation.
- **Silence timeout** – Time the assistant waits before responding if the user is silent.
- **Silent message** – What the assistant says if silence is detected.
- **Interruption time** – Controls when the assistant can interrupt the user.
- **Recognizer confidence threshold** – Adjust how strictly the assistant interprets voice input.

> 💡 These settings help fine-tune the assistant’s responsiveness and user experience.
