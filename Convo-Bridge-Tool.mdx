## ðŸ§© Introduction

**ConvoBridge** is ideal for situations where capturing details such as email addresses, home addresses, or other relevant information is more efficient through text chat rather than voice. After gathering these details via chat, the conversation can smoothly continue with a phone agent.

### âœ… Prerequisites

- An AI chat SMS agent or AI WhatsApp chat agent  
- A phone agent setup using either Web call or Phone Number  
- A form that will capture the details  

> **Note:** The tool will be connected to the parent widget (i.e., Phone Assistant), and the form will connect to the bridged widget (i.e., Chat Assistant).

In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to configure ConvoBridge in two main ways:

- **Option A:** Phone assistant to SMS widget  
- **Option B:** Phone assistant to WhatsApp widget

## ðŸ”— Connect with Phone Assistant and Trigger Using Prompt

7. Connect with Your Phone Assistant

Use the following prompt sample for configuring your assistant logic:

```text
Greet the user by thanking them for calling Computer Care and ask their name.

If they ask to disconnect the call, then do it.

Then ask for their phone number including country code.

To capture their information, hand off the conversation and ask the user to provide the information on WhatsApp.

During the handoff, any submissions received must be acknowledged and spelled back to the user (e.g., email address, home address).

Once the user confirms, check if the handoff is completed and verify each detail by spelling it out.

If validated by the user, thank them and disconnect the call.
