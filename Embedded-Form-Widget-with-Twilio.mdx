Turn form submissions into real-time conversations! This guide walks you through setting up the Embedded Form Widget with Twilio, where users fill out a form on your websiteâ€”including their phone numberâ€”and instantly receive a call from your AI agent to handle their queries.

Perfect for lead capture, support, or qualification workflows, this widget bridges form interaction and voice automation seamlessly.

âš¡ As soon as the form is submitted, the AI-initiated call is triggeredâ€”no delays, no manual follow-ups!

1. **Create Your Form with a Phone Field**

Before setting up the Embedded Form Widget with Twilio, make sure youâ€™ve already created a form in Insighto that includes a phone number field.

ðŸ”— [Follow this guide to learn how to create a form in Insighto](https://docs.insighto.ai/Insighto.ai-Forms)â†’

For this setup, weâ€™re using a form that has already been created and includes all necessary fieldsâ€”especially the Phone field, which is required to trigger the AI call.

2.  **Set Up Your Voice Assistant**

To handle the call triggered by the form, youâ€™ll need to have a Voice-type Assistant configured in Insighto.

ðŸ”— [Click here to learn how to create a Voice Assistant](https://docs.insighto.ai/Build-Your-First-Voice-Agent)â†’

Make sure the assistant is trained to handle the type of queries expected from users submitting the form. This assistant will be the one engaging with the user over the call initiated via Twilio.
