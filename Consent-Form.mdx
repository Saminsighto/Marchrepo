Create a GDPR Consent Form


Letâ€™s start by creating a form that includes a GDPR consent field along with any additional fields you want to capture from users.

1âƒ£ Add a GDPR Consent Field

In your form builder, add a field of type GDPR (or similar, depending on your platform).

Be sure to include a link to your Privacy Policy in the field so users can review it before giving consent.

2âƒ£ Enable Mandatory Form Submission

In the form settings, toggle the option to make form submission mandatory.

This ensures that users must complete the GDPR consent and any other required fields before they can interact with the chat widget.

3âƒ£ Add Additional Fields (Optional)

Add any other fields you want to capture, such as name, email, phone number, etc.

Arrange these fields as needed to support your chat use case.

ðŸ’¡ Note: If youâ€™re unsure how to create a form in your system, refer to the detailed guide linked Insighto.ai Forms - Insighto.ai Docs for step-by-step instructions.
