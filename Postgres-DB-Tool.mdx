The Postgres DB tool lets you connect your existing **PostgreSQL** database directly to Insighto and run **SQL queries** to fetch information in real-time.

For example, if you have a logistics table in your database, you can connect it, select the columns you want to access, and use them to fetch details based on user input during conversations. This helps you provide **precise answers** and **data-driven insights** to your usersâ€”directly from your database.
