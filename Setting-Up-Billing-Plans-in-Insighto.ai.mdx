title: Setting Up Billing Plans in Insighto.ai
description: Learn how to create and manage billing plans using Stripe integration in Insighto.
---

With Stripe integrated, you can now set up billing plans for your clients.

Insighto.ai allows you to create three types of plans: **Regular**, **Add-ons**, and **Hidden**.

### Regular Plans

These are standard billing plans your users subscribe to and are charged monthly. The first plan you create will automatically be set as the default and will be free.

### Add-ons

Add-on plans can be bought on top of regular plans to meet extended needs. You can create special add-ons such as storage add-ons or Voice credit Add-ons Queries Add.

### Hidden Plans

These are still under development and are yet to be decided.

## 2. Fill in Plan Details

After clicking “Add Plan”, a form will appear where you can configure the billing plan. Here’s what to do:

- **Plan Name**: Enter a clear and customer-facing name for the plan (e.g., Starter Plan, Premium Add-on).
- **Plan Type**: Choose from the dropdown:
  - Regular – A standard subscription plan.
  - Add-on – An optional upgrade or additional feature.
  - Hidden – A plan not visible to users but can be assigned manually.
- **Stripe Mapping**: Select the corresponding product and price you've set up in Stripe using the dropdown.
- **Description**: Provide a brief overview of what the plan includes and who it’s for.

> 💡 Make sure the plan name and Stripe mapping match what you configured earlier for consistency and accurate billing.

## 3. Set Usage Limits for the Plan

In this section, define the resource limits your customers will get under this plan. These limits help you control usage and allocate credits based on pricing tiers.

- **Assistants #**: Maximum number of assistants a user can create within this plan.
- **Queries #**: Number of chat assistant credits included.
- **Words #**: Total word count allowed in the user’s knowledge base (documents, FAQs, etc.).
- **Voice #**: Number of voice assistant credits included.

## Note on Credit Consumption Variability

The default credit mapping assumes use of a regular LLM and standard voice provider:

- 1 credit = 1 chat query
- 1 credit = 1 second of voice usage

If the customer upgrades to a premium LLM or a premium voice provider (e.g., ElevenLabs), the credit consumption increases.

For example, with ElevenLabs:

- 2.5 credits = 1 second of voice usage

So, if you allocate 6,000 credits (normally ~100 minutes of regular voice), it would only provide ~40 minutes when using a premium voice provider.

> 📌 It's important to inform your customers that choosing advanced models or providers will reduce total available usage within their credit limits.

## 4. Select Feature Access for the Plan

Use the dropdown options to control which premium features are included in this plan. Choose **Yes** or **No** for each:

- **Premium Support?**  
Grants users access to priority support channels and faster response times.

- **Allow Removing Brand from Widgets?**  
Allows users to remove or replace Insighto branding from chat and voice widgets—ideal for white-label use.

- **Advanced Intents?**  
Lets users create and manage their own custom intents, giving them full control over conversation design.

- **Auto Intents?**  
Gives users access to predefined, auto-generated intents available within Insighto—helpful for fast setup without custom configuration.

> 💡 Use these settings to tailor feature access per plan tier. Advanced tools like custom intents may be ideal for higher-tier plans.

## 5. Enable or Restrict Specific Features

In this step, you can allow or restrict access to advanced features by setting each field to either:

- **1 = Enabled** (feature will be accessible to users in this plan)  
- **0 = Disabled** (feature will not be available in this plan)

Here’s what each option controls:

- **Forms**: Allows users to create and use forms  
- **Custom Voice**: Enables users to upload and use their own voice.  
- **Custom Tools**: Gives users the ability to integrate their own APIs or functions as tools within assistants.  
- **Live Agents**: Allows handover to human support agents via a live chat interface.  
- **Twilio Integration**: Grants access to integrate with Twilio for phone call capabilities.  
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Enables communication through WhatsApp using supported integration.

> 🔒 Setting a value of 0 disables the feature completely for users in this billing plan.
