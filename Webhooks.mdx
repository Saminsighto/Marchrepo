FWebhooks let you send data from Insighto to other platforms in real-time. You can use them to connect with external tools, automate tasks, and keep everything in sync. This guide will show you how to set up webhooks in Insighto and connect them with assistants or forms to push data wherever you need it.

4. Enter Webhook Details

In the form, provide the following information:

- **Name**: Enter a clear and descriptive name for your webhook.  
- **Endpoint URL**: Input the URL from the platform you‚Äôre creating a workflow with (e.g., Zapier, Make, or any other system).  

This tells Insighto where to send the data when this webhook is triggered.

5. Manage Your Webhook

After creating the webhook, you‚Äôll see it listed in the Webhooks section. Here, you can:

- Check logs to see the activity for this webhook.  
- Edit the webhook details if you need to make changes.  
- Delete the webhook if it‚Äôs no longer needed.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Each webhook connected to a form or assistant must be unique. Avoid reusing the same webhook across multiple forms or assistants to ensure your data flows correctly and actions trigger without conflicts.
